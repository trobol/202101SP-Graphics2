// ****TO-DO:
//	-> declare view-space varyings from vertex shader
//	-> declare MRT for pertinent surface data (incoming attribute info)
//		(hint: at least normal and texcoord are needed)
//	-> declare uniform samplers (at least normal map)
//	-> calculate final normal
//	-> output pertinent surface data

layout (location = 0) out vec4 rtFragColor;

void main()

	// DUMMY OUTPUT: all fragments are OPAQUE MAGENTA
	rtFragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
