// ****TO-DO:
//	-> declare biased clip coordinate varying from vertex shader
//	-> declare point light data structure and uniform block
//	-> declare pertinent samplers with geometry data ("g-buffers")
//	-> calculate screen-space coordinate from biased clip coord
//		(hint: perspective divide)
//	-> use screen-space coord to sample g-buffers
//	-> calculate view-space fragment position using depth sample
//		(hint: same as deferred shading)
//	-> calculate final diffuse and specular shading for current light only
