// ****TO-DO:
// 1) core transformation and lighting setup:
//	-> declare data structures for projector and model matrix stacks
//		(hint: copy and slightly modify demo object descriptors)
//	-> declare uniform block for matrix data
//		(hint: must match how it is uploaded in update function)
//	-> use matrix data for current object to perform relevant transformations
//		(hint: model-view-projection sequence may be split up like last time, 
//		but per usual the final clip-space result is assigned to gl_Position)
//	-> declare relevant attributes for lighting
//	-> perform any additional transformations and write varyings for lighting
// 2) shadow mapping
//	-> using the above setup, perform additional transformation to generate a 
//		"shadow coordinate", which is a "biased clip-space" coordinate from 
//		the light's point of view
//		(hint: transformation sequence is model-view-projection-bias)
//	-> declare and write varying for shadow coordinate
