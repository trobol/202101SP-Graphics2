// ****TO-DO: 
//	-> declare varying data to read from vertex shader
//		(hint: it's an array this time, one per vertex in primitive)
//	-> use vertex data to generate lines that highlight the input triangle
//		-> wireframe: one at each corner, then one more at the first corner to close the loop
//		-> vertex tangents: for each corner, new vertex at corner and another extending away 
//			from it in the direction of each basis (tangent, bitangent, normal)
//		-> face tangents: ditto but at the center of the face; need to calculate new bases
//	-> call "EmitVertex" whenever you're done with a vertex
//		(hint: every vertex needs gl_Position set)
//	-> call "EndPrimitive" to finish a new line and restart
//	-> experiment with different geometry effects

// (2 verts/axis * 3 axes/basis * (3 vertex bases + 1 face basis) + 4 to 8 wireframe verts = 28 to 32 verts)
