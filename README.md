# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

How to properly use:

Uppercase J and K to switch between render passes
Lowercase j and k to toggle between activating multiple light sources
P to reload all shaders
WASD to move around the scene and scroll to zoom
left mouse click and drag to rotate


## FINAL

a large portion of my time was spent on making and rendering signed distance fields of fonts.
i didn't include the code with the animal3d repo because it required external libraries.
it is one c file and a few headers but the output of it is within this repo.
the source code for the signed distance field generator is here https://github.com/trobol/signed_dist_font
